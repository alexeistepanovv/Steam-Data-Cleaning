# Data Cleaning for Steam Scraped Data

This project is a continuation of the [Steam Scraper Project](https://github.com/your-steam-scraper-repo-link), focusing on the cleaning of raw scraped data from Steam and SteamSpy.

## Description
The objective of this extension is to refine the scraped data, making it more usable for analysis. This involves handling missing values, correcting data formats, and extracting meaningful information from complex data structures.

## File Descriptions
- `steam_cleaning.py`: Contains functions and processes for cleaning the data scraped from Steam. It includes operations like handling missing values, data type conversions, and data integrity checks.
- `steamspy_cleaning.py`: Similar to `steam_cleaning.py`, but focused on cleaning data scraped from SteamSpy. It includes specific functions tailored to the data structure and contents of SteamSpy.

## Technology Stack
The data cleaning scripts are built using Python, with an emphasis on libraries such as:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- `re`: Regular expression operations for string data manipulation.
- `json`: For parsing and manipulating JSON formatted data.

## Acknowledgments
This data cleaning project is an extension of the Steam scraper, originally inspired by the work of [Nik Davis](https://nik-davis.github.io/). Special thanks to his contributions which laid the groundwork for these advanced data operations.
